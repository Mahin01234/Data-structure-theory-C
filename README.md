# Data Structure Theory

> A collection of **C and C++ programs** implementing different data structures and algorithms, along with sorting techniques.

---

## 📘 Introduction

This repository is designed for students and beginners who want to learn **data structures and algorithms** with practical examples.  
It contains programs written in **C and C++** covering:

- Sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)
- Data structure–related implementations (Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.)
- General practice programs for better understanding of theory.
